# DS Algorithms Project

The task was to design, implement, and thoroughly evaluate a variety of algorithms and
associated data structures to solve the set membership problem (that is, to find an
element in a set) under the conditions of limited storage, large A and need to
answer queries in real-time. No Python libraries could be used except for bitarray to implement 
the data structures. 

Evaluation was conducted both theoretically (in terms of space and time
complexity), and experimentally. For experimentation, both real and synthetic
data was used.
